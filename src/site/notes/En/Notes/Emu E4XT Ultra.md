##  Internal SSD 
Bases on a tip in a [forum](http://www.sequencer.de/synthesizer/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=79915#p866249), it is possible to replace the internal noisy 3,5" HD with a silent SSD.

## Shopping List
* [Wintech SAK-65](http://www.wintech-computer.de/wt_de_product_detail.php?anr=81319)
* [Raidsonic IB-2216StS 2.5" Mobile Rack](http://www.raidsonic.de/de/products/mobile-racks.php?we_objectID=7700)
* [Samsung MZ-7TE120BW Serie 840](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Samsung%20MZ-7TE120BW%20Serie%20840)
##  Replacement 
The replacement is straight forward. Just remove cable and unmount the old drive. Mount the mobile rack with the two screws towards backside within the original holes, for the two screws towards fron you need selfthreading screws. On the SAK-65 Adapter a missing hole has to be drilled, see image:
